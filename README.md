# My Top 5

1. Charging Station (OOP)
    - I was tasked with writing an OOP code for developing a Charging Station network for the Quicka Autonomous Vehicles that can serve as charging and docking points for delivery vehicles, this Task uses Java interfaces, Abstraction, Inheritance and Polymorphism.

2. Basic Vehicle (OOP)
    - I was tasked with designing software for the tracking of all the self-driving vehicles across the world, this was done first by creating a blueprint of all the vehicles, this is seen with the Basic Vehicle Class, then develop a delivery vehicle that can carry a limited number of equally weighted boxes. To do this we can build off of our previous task by extending the BasicVehicle class.

3. Logging (File I/0)
    - In this task our self-driving transports had a internal reporting and logging system that records events and issues during rides. These logfiles contain the last 1000 events/messages as well as their status codes.
    
    - Since the logfiles are so big, the task was to display a certain number of
    lines at a time. thus wrote a code that  prompts the user to choose start and end line numbers and print all the lines from start to end (inclusive).

    - Also tasked to track and find the first error message and diplay it, which will help the user see why, where and how things went wrong

    - lastly the task was to write a code that is able to generate a summary for each logfile to give us a rough idea of its contents.

4. MathGui (Java Swing)
    - This is a program so dear to me, because i myself have improved it from what it initially was to what it is now. Initially we were tasked with writing a Java Swing Gui application that allows the user to guess the answer of two numbers that are added together then print out correct or wrong, depending on the answer.

    - So what i had done was make it more interactive, i made it in a way that it allows the user to have 3 attempts of guessing, then as the user guesses it updates the score, say the user guessed twice and got them correct and one wrong, the score update would be 2-1, and then it would tell the user that they Won, if the had more wrongs than right(correct), then it would tell the user that they lost, and prompt them to play again.

5. FahrenheitToCelcius (Basic Java)
    - This program converts temperature from fahenreit to celcius
